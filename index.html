                  <p class="hometext">BITS GOA RACING is the Formula Student team of BITS Pilani – K.K. Birla Goa Campus
                        that manufactures a formula inspired open cockpit racing vehicle. The entire vehicle is designed
                        and manufactured in-house by the students. Despite the infeasibility in manufacturing in Goa,
                        the entire car is built, modified and assembled by the team. <br><br>

                        The car undergoes various tests where it should satisfy certain criteria. The team has various
                        sub-divisions that take up the responsibility of the respective sub-section of the car. Under
                        the guidance of our faculty and technical advisors, the team has been able to achieve great
                        heights of success in the past years. A major contribution to a successful project by the team
                        constitutes the participation of the sponsors.<br><br>

                        BITS GOA RACING has been affiliated with some of the most prestigious companies in the past,
                        which has led to a fruitful relationship for both the sides. We expect to achieve greater
                        heights in future events with the help of our sponsors and the technical experience gained in
                        past experiences. </p>
